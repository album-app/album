## Summary

`album` is a framework for scientific data processing with software
solutions of heterogeneous tools. With a focus on open-source
scientific software, `album` is used to run, distribute, and create
software solutions composed of tools implemented in a variety of
languages. An underlying motivation of `album` is support of
[FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) (Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible) software solutions that
supports a wide variety of tools that run natively, on HPCs, require
interactivity, and more.

`album` has been tested with tools implemented in Python, C++, R,
Java, Kotlin, and more.
