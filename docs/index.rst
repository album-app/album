Welcome to album's documentation!
=================================

album is a framework for scientific data processing with software
solutions of heterogeneous tools. With a focus on open-source
scientific software, album is used to run, distribute, and create
software solutions composed of tools implemented in a variety of
languages. An underlying motivation of album is support of
`FAIR`_ (Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible) software solutions that
supports a wide variety of tools that run natively, on HPCs, require
interactivity, and more.

album has been tested with tools implemented in Python, C++, R,
Java, Kotlin, and more.
